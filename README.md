# Pythoe-HW
Here I presented the script with two classes: DNA class and RNA class.
For DNA class objects, you can (replace "str" to your sequence):
1) Initialize your sequence by Dna(str)
2) Calculate GC content by str.gc()
3) Build reverse complement sequence by str.reverse_complement(). Result will be the sequence from 5' to 3'.
4) Transcribe your sequence by str.transcribe(). Notice you should write the type of your sequence (sense or antisense) from 5' to 3'.

For Rna class objects, you can (replace "str" to your sequence):
1) Initialize your sequence by Rna(str)
2) Calculate GC content by str.gc()
3) Build reverse complement sequence by str.reverse_complement(). Result will be the sequence from 5' to 3'.
